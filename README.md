# 👋 Hi, I'm Lucas!

I'm passionate about **numbers** and **data**, which naturally led me to programming.  
At the same time, I have a strong artistic side — I worked as a designer when I was younger — so pursuing a **Full Stack Developer** path feels like the perfect fit for my journey, combining both analytical and creative skills.


## 🚀 Technologies

- 🌐 HTML5
- 🎨 CSS3
- 🐍 Python (Basic)
- 📚 Currently learning **JavaScript**
- 🔜 Future studies: Frameworks, APIs, Databases, and possibly **Java** and **React**

I'm open to expanding my knowledge thoughtfully, focusing on mastering essential tools without spreading myself too thin.  
Dedication and excellence are key values I bring to my learning process.


## 📚 Currently Learning

I'm diving deeper into:
- **JavaScript** for frontend and backend development
- Understanding **APIs** and **database** management
- Exploring frameworks like **React** and **Node.js**
- Evaluating **Java** for potential backend specialization

My goal is to build a solid, high-level skill set that allows me to grow into a capable and versatile developer.


## 🌟 Open to Opportunities

Although I'm still early in my coding journey, I’m open to:
- **Internship roles**
- **Junior developer positions**
- **Freelance projects**

I'm committed to continuous learning and growth to become a top-level developer.
